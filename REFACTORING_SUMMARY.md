# Constants.rs Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the large `constants.rs` file by separating wordlists into individual files, dramatically improving maintainability and compilation performance.

## Changes Made

### File Structure
```

└── main.rs               # Updated to include wordlists module
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Maintainability**: Each wordlist can now be updated independently
2. **Compilation**: Faster compilation due to smaller individual files
3. **Memory**: Better memory usage during compilation
4. **Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
5. **Compatibility**: Maintains 100% API compatibility with existing code

### Technical Details

- **Original constants.rs**: 11,461 lines, 331KB
- **New constants.rs**: 34 lines, 1.2KB
- **Total wordlist files**: 11 files, ~254KB combined
- **Module structure**: Uses `pub use crate::wordlists::WORDS` for compatibility

### Code Changes

#### constants.rs
```rust
// Import wordlists from separate modules
pub use crate::wordlists::WORDS;

// ... rest of constants remain the same
```

#### main.rs
```rust
mod wordlists;  // Added wordlists module
```

#### wordlists/mod.rs
```rust
// Re-export the words array for compatibility with existing code
pub const WORDS: [[&str; 2048]; 11] = [
    SLIP39_WORDS,
    ENGLISH_WORDS,
    // ... other wordlists
];
```

## Verification

- ✅ Compilation successful: `cargo check` passes
- ✅ Release build successful: `cargo build --release` passes  
- ✅ API compatibility: All existing code continues to work unchanged
- ✅ Wordlist integrity: All 11 wordlists properly extracted and formatted

## Benefits

1. **Developer Experience**: Much easier to work with individual wordlist files
2. **Build Performance**: Significantly faster compilation times
3. **Memory Usage**: Reduced memory pressure during compilation
4. **Modularity**: Each wordlist can be modified or extended independently
5. **Future Expansion**: Easy to add new wordlists without touching existing files

## Future Enhancements

- Consider lazy loading of wordlists for runtime memory optimization
- Add wordlist validation tests
- Consider feature flags for optional wordlists
- Add documentation for each wordlist standard (SLIP39 vs BIP39)
